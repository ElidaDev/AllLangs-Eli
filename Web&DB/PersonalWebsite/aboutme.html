            <p>I’m Elijah “Eli” Fisher, and I’ve always had a deep passion for computers and technology. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how computers work, whether it’s programming, troubleshooting, or exploring new software. My interest in computers has driven me to continuously expand my knowledge and skills. As I continue to learn and grow, my goal is to get a career in the tech industry, where I can apply what I know to solve problems.</p>
            <p>I took many courses at my highschool for computer science, and eventually I ran out of courses offered in this field there, so I decided to start attending SICTC. I eventually got in, and I am now learning more about Software Development aswell as Web Development there. I have learned more than just tech skills at SICTC, It has also taught me soft skills and communication skills.</p>
